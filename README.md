Data 512 Final project

## Introduction

In this Project, I would like to get a better understanding of how the wages of players are decided in Major league Baseball(MLB). I would like to build a machine learning model to understand the important variables that decide the wages for a player and analyze their relative importance. Additionally, I would also like to answer the question if the interpretability of models is consistent across similar performing models.

## Project Purpose

My research questions is around a persons race and his salary structure in MLB. There is ever increasing talks around steep drop in African-american players in MLB so I want to explore if disparity in wages is a reason for this decline. On a more Human centred context if such disparity exists this would potentially affect future/aspiring African-american youth/kids to play the beautiful game.

**RQ1: What are the most significant factors in determining a players wage in MLB.**

**RQ2: How consistently interpretable are these results across algorithms with similar perfromance.**



## Reproducibility

To make the results reproducible I have included all the steps required for data cleaning in this notebook and additionally provided initial setup for the workflow in the Readme.md. All the raw files are available in the repo's ```data``` folder alongside processed data files as well. Alongside this all the graphs/images are also shared in the ```image``` folder.

```conda install -c anaconda xlrd 
conda install -c anaconda matplotlib 
conda install -c conda-forge lightgbm 
conda install -c anaconda scikit-learn 
conda install -c mikesilva xgboost
```
