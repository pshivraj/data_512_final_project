Data 512 Final project

## Introduction

In this Project, I would like to get a better understanding of how the wages of players are decided in Major league Baseball(MLB). I would like to build a machine learning model to understand the important variables that decide the wages for a player and analyze their relative importance. Additionally, I would also like to answer the question if the interpretability of models is consistent across similar performing models.
